# Weather Dashboard

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `config.js` with your OpenWeatherMap API key
4. Open index.html in your browser

## Note
The `config.js` file is ignored by Git to keep API keys secure. Make sure to create your own `config.js` based on the example file.
